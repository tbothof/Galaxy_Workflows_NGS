# Galaxy_Workflows_NGS

This repository contains Galaxy workflows created during NGS Analysis classes.

## Workflow 1: Introduction to Galaxy

This is the [first workflow](Galaxy-Workflow-Introduction_Workflow.ga).

## Workflow 2: Unicycler hybrid assembly + Antibiotic resistance detection

In [this workflow](./Galaxy-Workflow-Unicycler_Hybrid_Assembly___Antibiotic_Resistance_Detection.ga), we use Unicycler to create a hybrid assembly, to be checked with some other tools for completeness as well as antibiotic resistance genes.

_After trimming of long and short reads, a Unicycler hybrid assembly was used. This was further analyzed using Quast, Prokka, Bandage and Abricate_

## Workflow 3: Pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy

This workflow encapsulates a near-complete workflow, starting with nanopore sequencing data and ending up with analytical data concerning antibiotic resistances and pathogenicity. Due to an error in Galaxy, the workflow could not be extracted. To compensate for this, screengrabs of the workflow can be seen below:
