# Galaxy_Workflows_NGS

This repository contains Galaxy workflows created during NGS Analysis classes.

## Workflow 1: Introduction to Galaxy

This is the [first workflow](Galaxy-Workflow-Introduction_Workflow.ga).

## Workflow 2: Unicycler hybrid assembly + Antibiotic resistance detection

In this workflow, we use Unicycler to create a hybrid assembly, to be checked with some other tools for completeness as well as antibiotic resistance genes.

_After trimming of long and short reads, a Unicycler hybrid assembly was used. This was further analyzed using Quast, Prokka, Bandage and Abricate_

## Workflow 3: Pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy
